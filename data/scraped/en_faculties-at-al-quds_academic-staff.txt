Rafik Karaman
Professor
Professor Rafik Karaman is currently a distinguished professor of pharmaceutical sciences, College of Pharmacy, Al-Quds University, Jerusalem, Palestine and adjunct professor at Basilicata University, Italy. He received his Ph.D. MS and bachelor degree in Pharmacy from the Hebrew University. He was an Assistant Professor at the University of Toledo and University of California for 5 years where he worked with Professor T.C. Bruice in the bioorganic chemistry field. Professor Karaman is broadly interested in the design and synthesis of prodrug systems to be used for the delivery of certain drugs that have poor water solubility or/and have low bioavailability as well as synthesis of prodrugs for masking the bitter sensation of commonly used drugs. The prodrug design is executed using ab initio, DFT, semiempirical, molecular mechanics as well as molecular dynamics and conformational dynamics methods. The overarching goal of Karaman’s research activities is to establish a method for obtaining prodrugs that their interconversion rates will be controlled or programmed by the chemical features of the linker (promoiety) attached to their active parent drugs. Professor Karaman has more than 180 peer-reviewed manuscripts and book chapters; 140 of them were published in the recent 9 years. He is currently an editor and an editorial board member of more than 50 international journals in the areas of pharmaceutical sciences.
Specialization areas:

Imad Barghouthi
Professor
Teaching philosophy:
After 26 years (1994 – 2021) of teaching and supervising graduate and undergraduate students and working very hard to be an excellent lecturer, I have decided to move from being lecturer to be a MOTIVATOR. Currently, I do not believe in the learning efficiency of lecture room teaching. The real learning happens in the research lab, in the library, or in the course of community work. Learning by doing, trial and error are the mottos of successful education. I have to teach skills and knowledge. The best education is through real projects. Therefore, my role as a Motivator is to motivate students to go to the lab, to do research lab, to go to the library, to communicate with the community, to explain physics for non-science students, to enhance the physics literacy of the university students and of the community. In addition, I am determined to fulfill the levels of knowledge (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation) among the students. Always, I am doing my best to convey knowledge in the sense of wisdom, paired with ethics and responsibility.
On-going research:
(I) Currently, I am working on developing my Monte Carlo code (Barghouthi model) in order to investigate the effects of altitude and velocity dependent wave – particle interactions by using our recent findings (Nilsson et al., 2012 a, b, see publications list). We will use this updated model to study the ion outflows in the polar wind and auroral regions. In addition, a comparison between the results of this Monte Carlo code and the results of other models is under investigation.
(II) It is a very challenge project, the project of investigating the double-hump distributions in the solar wind. The Puzzle of fast solar wind (i.e., Helium ions are faster than Hydrogen ions in the solar wind) still unsolved issue, because heavier ions are expected to move slower than lighter ions in the solar wind. I am planning to build up a Monte Carlo code to investigate the physics of the solar wind. In specific, I am interested to study the effects of Coulomb collisions and wave – particle interactions on the H+ ions outflow in the solar wind. I have the potential to do that because there are many similarities between the physics of the polar wind (my expertise area) and the solar wind. Because of this research, I will be able to explain (theoretically) the observed H+ double-hump distributions in the solar wind and provide an explanation to the fast solar wind.
(III) Also, I am planning to modify my Monte Carlo code for the behavior
of O+ ions in the ionosphere by including the effects of NO+ molecular ions and other molecular ions. Knowing the exact behavior of O+ ions in the ionosphere is very important to the community of space communications.
Publications (Total 57 ): I have been involved in 2 lines of research:
Line 1: The field of theoretical space plasma physics, 42 papers in leading journals.
Line 2: The interdisciplinary fields of scientific literacy, education, and Islam and science, 15 publications in local and regional journals.

Work experience
1983 – 1988
1992-presemt Chemistry Teaching Assistant
Lecturer in Organic Chemistry
Main duties performed:
• Working alongside my colleagues to provide consistent education for all students
• Regularly instructing experiments and teaching students how to replicate the experiments under safe conditions
• Writing and marking examination papers
• Marking homework, quizzes and tests
• Educating students on the health and safety regulations in a lab
• Working with students on both an individual and group basis on activities and workbooks
• Monitoring students’ work performance
I have enjoyed an extensive career teaching students Chemistry, which has allowed me to gain substantial knowledge and expertise in education, besides vastly, improved my teaching abilities. I also believe that my friendly personality and calm temperament are very harmonious with the requirements of a good lecturer. My communication skills are excellent; as are my interpersonal skills—which are useful during interactions with students, and administrators alike.
In addition to education, I participate in the administrative system as a director of registration and as a coordinator of the academic load of the university.
