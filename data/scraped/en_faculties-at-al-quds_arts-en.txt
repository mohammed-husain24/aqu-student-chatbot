Dean Message
In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful
On my behalf and on behalf of the professors and staff of the Faculty of Arts, I am pleased to welcome you to this ancient and pioneering scientific edifice, which was established more than four decades ago of giving, pioneering and fruitful interaction with all components of the Palestinian society. This edifice, which I hope, will continue successfully in offering more distinguished academic programs to meet with the needs of the Palestinian, regional and international community.
The Faculty of Arts was established in the year (1402 AH corresponding to 1982 AD) under the name of the “College of Arts for Girls” in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of Jerusalem, as a development for the Institute of Social Service in the “Arab Child House” institution, which was established by the late, Ms. “Hind Taher Al-Husseini”, may her soul rest in peace, for the care and education of a number of children of the “Deir Yassin village”, and in the year (1415 AH / 1994 AD) it was actually united with colleges such as Da’wa, Fundamentals of Religion, the Qur’an, and Islamic Studies in the Beit Hanina neighborhood, the College of Science and Technology in the Abu Dis neighborhood, and the Arab Colleges for Health Professions in the city of Al-Bireh, which later on formed, Al-Quds University, the dream that began in the year (1336 AH / 1914 AD) under the name of “Salah Al-Din Islamic College” in buildings like, The Salahiya School located to the right of the entrance to the Old City in Jerusalem from the Lions (Asbaat) Gate, and it took eight decades to achieve it, with a solid will.
After its unification, Al-Quds University witnessed many developments in all fields, including the establishment of the College of Arts in the Beit Hanina neighborhood, along with the College of Arts for Girls in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. The Faculty of Arts and the branches of a number of university faculties moved from the Beit Hanina campus to the “Abu Dis” campus, and thus the Faculty of Arts settled today with two branches: Hind Al-Husseini College for Girls on the campus of Sheikh Jarrah, and the College of Arts in the Abu Dis campus, which is the fourth college of the university to be established, out of seventeen colleges: The College of Arts currently offers academic programs at the undergraduate level: Arabic Language and Literature, English Language and Literature, Social Work, Physical Education, and Fine Arts. Seven academic programs at the master’s level: Arabic language and literature, contemporary Islamic studies, Translation and Interpretation, Criminology, Jerusalem Studies, Digital Communication, Leadership in Physical Education, Strategic Studies, and Public Policies.
The Higher Institute of Archeology offers two programs: Islamic Antiquities, Conservation and Restoration, and the Institute of Regional and International Studies offers three programs: Arabic Studies, Israeli Studies, and European Studies. The Language Center offers service courses of foreign languages ​​to university students, and the Arabic language to non-native speakers for foreign students, wishing to learn fluent Arabic and the Palestinian spoken dialect, as well as courses in Palestinian society and customs. It aspires to offer a doctorate degree in Arabic Language and Literature, and Contemporary Islamic Studies.
The Faculty of Arts, with its various programs, seeks to achieve the goals of Al-Quds University, represented in preparing enlightened Palestinian graduates, who believe in their just cause and in their right to free their homeland. The college is keen on communicating and establishing academic and research relations with national, Arab, Islamic and international universities, through holding joint scientific conferences and courses. Exchanging visits by faculty members and students, teaching joint courses, and carrying out archaeological excavations, all with the aim of providing the best scientific, academic and professional environment for faculty members, staff and students, and promoting the Palestinian historical narrative, which is subject to attempts of obliteration, appropriation and distortion, unprecedented in human history. The college also, aims, with its various programs to educate the Palestinian generations about their sacred and immutable right to their homeland, historic Palestine.
Since its establishment, thousands of qualified students have graduated from the college, and many of them have excelled as creative teachers, writers, thinkers, artists, painters, and political leaders who have played an important role in the development of the Palestinian society, as well as, regional and global societies. These are a source of pride for the college, the university, and Palestine, and a source of inspiration and creativity for their peers.
The College of Arts would not have been able to present what it did without the collaboration of its colleagues, faculty members and employees. Its graduates and the graduates of the best local, Arab, and international universities, and those with a long history in scientific research, professional work, and service to the local community, who are keen to continue their academic achievements, develop their research activities, and interact with the Palestinian community in a way that leads to achieving the higher goals of the university.
The College of Arts, with all its academic programs and extracurricular services, and in concerted efforts with the rest of the university’s faculties, its scientific and office facilities, and its extracurricular activities, and with the wisdom of its president and the dedication of the faculty and staff in serving the students, and guiding them to what is best in their creative academic achievement and their prosperity, invites students to choose it as a place for their University studies, and their distinguished academic achievement, as they will fulfill their hopes and aspirations, and push them to succeed and excel in their academic and practical lives.
