Dean Message
It is my pleasure to welcome you to the website of the Faculty of Pharmacy at Al-Quds University. Through its mission, Al Quds University seeks to provide a unique academic and research environment based on stimulating and encouraging critical thinking and scientific research by providing programs aimed at enriching knowledge and meeting the needs of the Palestinian society.
As part of this distinguished university mission, the mission of the Faculty of Pharmacy is to educate students to provide pharmaceutical care, to promote research and scholarly activities in the pharmaceutical sciences, and to serve as a pharmacy resource for the Palestinian society and others around the world.
In 2002, the Faculty of Pharmacy was founded as one of the faculties of the university’s health complex. Since then, the faculty has been in many stages of development and has achieved consecutive successes at all levels. It has established a postgraduate program, three research laboratories and many research groups that have carried out dozens of research projects and published hundreds of scientific research papers in various pharmaceutical fields. Moreover, our graduates have been a key player in building the pharmaceutical system in Palestine and have distinguished contributions in all fields of pharmacy. Recently, the graduates of our faculty gained recognition for practicing pharmacy in the Palestinian areas of (1948).
Our faculty is dedicated to achieving excellence in an environment of interdisciplinary co-operation, and mutual respect, consistent with the mission of the University and with the mission of the profession of Pharmacy.
If you want to enter the pharmacy profession, the Faculty of Pharmacy at Al Quds University is welcoming you.

FACULTY OF PHARMACY
Faculty of Pharmacy
The Faculty of Pharmacy was founded in 2002. It is one of the faculties of the Health Complex at Al-Quds University in Abu-Dies campus which includes Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry, Public Health, and Health Professions. We offer a bachelor’s degree in pharmacy (B.Pharm) which develops a comprehensive understanding of how drugs are developed and medications affect the human body.
Moreover, we offer a master’s degree in pharmaceutical sciences (MSc) which focusses on pharmaceutical researches through its only-thesis track. Currently, more than 640 students are matriculated in our faculty, of which 30 are in the Master’s Program.
Since its foundation, our faculty has provided the Palestinian and international labor market with hundreds of pharmacists who have contributed distinctly in various fields, especially in the field of scientific research, drug development, improving the quality of pharmaceutical services, and many graduates who have received scholarships and completed their postgraduate studies. Furthermore, the graduates of our faculty achieve the highest success rates in the professional exams in Palestine and in the 1948 areas to becoming a registered pharmacist and playing a vital and rewarding role in healthcare provision.
The Faculty has a distinguished cadre of full, associate and assistant professors with distinguished research and professional contributions and patents in various fields of pharmacy. It also includes many competent lecturers, research and teaching assistants, and laboratory technicians.
We work in cooperation with many Palestinian pharmaceutical companies and institutions in order to improve the industry and to improve the quality of the pharmaceutical service respectively.
The Faculty has also partnerships with many European universities so that our students from their second year can take advantage of the student exchange programs and visit these universities for a period ranging from one week to one semester.

Rafik Karaman
Professor
Professor Rafik Karaman is currently a distinguished professor of pharmaceutical sciences, College of Pharmacy, Al-Quds University, Jerusalem, Palestine and adjunct professor at Basilicata University, Italy. He received his Ph.D. MS and bachelor degree in Pharmacy from the Hebrew University. He was an Assistant Professor at the University of Toledo and University of California for 5 years where he worked with Professor T.C. Bruice in the bioorganic chemistry field. Professor Karaman is broadly interested in the design and synthesis of prodrug systems to be used for the delivery of certain drugs that have poor water solubility or/and have low bioavailability as well as synthesis of prodrugs for masking the bitter sensation of commonly used drugs. The prodrug design is executed using ab initio, DFT, semiempirical, molecular mechanics as well as molecular dynamics and conformational dynamics methods. The overarching goal of Karaman’s research activities is to establish a method for obtaining prodrugs that their interconversion rates will be controlled or programmed by the chemical features of the linker (promoiety) attached to their active parent drugs. Professor Karaman has more than 180 peer-reviewed manuscripts and book chapters; 140 of them were published in the recent 9 years. He is currently an editor and an editorial board member of more than 50 international journals in the areas of pharmaceutical sciences.
Specialization areas:
