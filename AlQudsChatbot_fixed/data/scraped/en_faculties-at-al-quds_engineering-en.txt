Dean Message
Greetings from the Najad Zeeni College of Engineering, a beacon of innovation and progress in the heart of Palestine. As we stand at the crossroads of a new epoch, our nation, with its rich history and vibrant potential, is poised to redefine its standing in the global arena, especially within the diverse and dynamic Arab world. The concept of ‘excellence’ here transcends the traditional boundaries, embedding itself in the very fabric of our burgeoning industrial sector.
In this transformative landscape, the field of engineering emerges not just as a discipline, but as a driving force for national advancement. Our engineers are more than just creators and builders; they are the architects of our future, the catalysts for a paradigm shift in the Palestinian industrial narrative. They are tasked with pioneering sustainable, innovative solutions that balance technological advancement with environmental stewardship.
The scope of engineering today is vast and multifaceted. It stretches from the robust heavy industries that forge infrastructures and machinery, shaping the backbone of our economy, to the light industries that weave into the everyday life of our people through consumer goods, food technology, and electronic advancements. Beyond these, lies the realm of soft industries, where software development intertwines with every facet of life, revolutionizing sectors from healthcare to heavy manufacturing, and everything in between.
At Najad Zeeni Faculty of Engineering, our vision is to nurture not just engineers, but global changemakers. Our curriculum is a blend of rigorous academic training, ethical grounding, and a deep understanding of the global context. We are committed to cultivating leaders who are ready to tackle complex challenges, innovate sustainably, and contribute meaningfully to both local communities and the global stage.
As you embark on your educational journey with us, remember that you are stepping into a role much larger than yourself. You are becoming part of a legacy of change and progress. Here, your ideas will not only be heard but will also be instrumental in shaping the future of our nation and the world. In our faculty, you’re not just learning engineering; you’re preparing to be a key player in an exciting era of global innovation and societal transformation.
Dr. Yara Saifi
Dean of the Faculty of Engineering
NAJJAD ZEENNI FACULTY OF ENGINEERING
Najjad Zeenni Faculty of Engineering
Najjad Zeenni Faculty of Engineering (NZFE) was established at Al-Quds University in 1999. At that time, it was based on two majors: Bachelor of Electronic Engineering and Bachelor of Computer Engineering. Since then, NZFE has evolved to include Bachelor degree programs in Materials Engineering, Communications Engineering, Architecture, Food Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as Master degree programs in Electronics and Computer Engineering, Renewable Energy and Sustainability (joint program) and Agribusiness (joint program). These are programs that complement each other to cover the widest possible spectrum of knowledge and skills necessary for the advancement of our Palestinian economy. NZFE focuses on programs that are unique in their specialization, different in their concepts, or different in their learning system. The Bachelor of Architecture program has a different concept compared to other similar programs in the country and region. The Bachelor of Electrical Engineering and Bachelor of Industrial Engineering programs are implemented by a new system in the Arab world, the Dual Study system. Other programs are unique programs in the sense that they are not duplicated in other universities. In NZFE study programs, there are groups of sciences and skills that students learn; there is the specialization and all related science and skills, but there is also everything related to skills in the workplace for the engineering profession, including communication skills, leadership and innovation. The purpose of all this is to give every engineer the assets she needs to succeed in the engineering profession and even be influential in the society and contribute to the development of Palestine.
