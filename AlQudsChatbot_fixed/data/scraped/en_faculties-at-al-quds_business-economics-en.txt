Dean Message
Welcome to the Faculty of Business and Economics at Al-Quds University (AQU). Our faculty is committed to excellence in undergraduate and graduate instructions, scientific research, and extension in business economics, business administration, accounting, finance, marketing as well as dual study programs in business administration and digital business. In 2018, AQU has signed an Agreement with the Institute of Competitiveness and Strategy at Harvard Business School for academic and research cooperation. The faculty members at AQU took part in several Faculty Workshops, Microeconomics of Competitiveness, Harvard Business School. As a result, AQU has already developed a promising and pioneer master’s program in “Competitiveness and Development Economics.” However, the faculty strives to be a world-class institution that can serve as an active catalyst to satisfy the current and future labor market needs by having highly qualified graduates. Most of the graduates have moved directly into employment in private or public organizations, in addition to other graduates who have been able to join their Ph.D. programs in prestigious international universities.
The vision of our faculty is to be a leading and highly respected faculty for its excellence in teaching, quality of research, and professional services. The faculty aspires to: (1) uphold high standards of academic performance, (2) respect students and provide them with quality education, (3) promote employment opportunities for students, (4) maintain a collegial work environment and (5) interact with the greater community and sustain improvement.
The mission is to support the missions of Al-Quds University by (1) providing quality instruction to students to prepare them for successful careers, (2) enhancing their knowledge through theoretical, applied and problem-oriented research for the benefit of students, faculty, and programs, and (3) offering service to the university and greater community and to advance knowledge in offered fields at the faculty.
The overall objective of our faculty is to provide both under and graduate students with rigorous and critical programs in theoretical and empirical studies. To achieve the main aim, our curricula are designed to: (1) provide a firm grounding in modern theory, (2) instill the capacity for independent thought about policies and problems, (3) develop the capacity for quantitative research, and (4) provide basic descriptive knowledge about Palestine and internationally.
Our top priority and first endeavor in the Faculty of Business and Economics is to occupy a prominent and distinguished position not only in Palestine but also in the region.
Yours truly,
Prof. Dr. Ibrahim M. Awad

FACULTY OF BUSINESS & ECONOMICS
Faculty of Business & Economics
Established in 2002, the Faculty of Business and Economics has rapidly become the most unique and distinguished of its kind in Palestine. We offer academic programs that are comparable to those offered by leading Higher Education Institutions in Palestine, as well as abroad.
Our faculty aims to provide students with a strong base of education in accounting, business administration and economics that will equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge for any of these chosen fields. It combines theory with real world applications, to develop a professional workforce.
In an unsteady economic climate, our business and economics programs have been designed to be adaptable to the needs of society, and train professionals to meet the urgent needs of the Palestinian community.
A variety of teaching and training methods are in use by the Institute of Business & Economics, with the objectives of achieving enhancing leadership abilities and improving analytical skills. In addition to formal lectures, students have to analyze case studies and prepare assignments. Students also participate in real-world events and attend applied workshops.
In the past, our graduates have gone on to have extremely successful careers. Our graduates go on to help business organizations in Palestine, and competitive contenders in global business market.
Over the past four decades, unfair policies practiced by Israeli Occupation Authorities have eroded the competitiveness of the Palestinian Economy. Therefore, we as a faculty must look for innovative ways to educate a new generation of business leaders to meet the economic changes of the world. We look to nurture students talents into those who are capable of integrating the Palestinian economy into the economies of rest of the region.
