FACULTY OF LAW
Faculty of Law
The Faculty of Law at Al-Quds University was established in 1992. It provides first-class education for lawyers-to-be at both basic and advanced level. Basic democratic values like equal treatment, non-discrimination and gender must permeate the whole curricula, programs, and all activities within the facility of Law. The faculty’s lecturers and researchers collaborate to a high degree with the community. The faculty adopts a participatory role, as lecturers work with their students to plan the training sessions and jointly prepare the instruction.
the Faculty of Law offers a number of introductory subjects to ensure that Law students receive a concrete grounding in the basic principles of law. The students are also entered the practice from the Faculty of Law in order to demonstrate applications of the law, as well as optional subjects in fields not directly related to law, such as public administration, criminology, business, Linguistics, and economics. The majority of our undergraduate bachelor of Law degree lasts for four years. This is not always the case, as some students may complete their courses in three years and a half.
The Faculty of Law has developed a large collection of links with partner institutions and key stakeholders at the local, regional, and global level. Such relationships provide our Facility with great opportunities to develop research projects, exchange of students and staff with other leading institutions, and collaborate in a variety of ways. The research conducted at the Faculty of Law is consistently superior and covers most of the various areas of legal science, including the fields of public and private laws, offering a great opportunity to contribute to nation and state building in Palestine.
